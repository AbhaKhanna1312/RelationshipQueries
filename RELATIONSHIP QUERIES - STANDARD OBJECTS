//Scenario 1
//  You have ben asked to work on fetching data from Account & Opportunity object
//  Fire query on secondary object & get data of primary object
//  Account : Industry field
//  Opportunity : Amount field

SELECT Amount, Account.Industry FROM Opportunity WHERE Amount = 40000

//Scenario 2
//You have been asked to work on fetching data from Account & Opportunity object
//Fire query on the primary object & get data of the secondary object

SELECT Name, (SELECT Amount FROM Opportunities) FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Chemicals'


//Scenario 3
//Now in the above query (as per scenario 2), we are getting all the records from the Account object where the industry = 'Chemicals'
//From the Opportunities object (as per scenario 2), we are getting the records where the amount = 30,000
//Now, if I want to show only those records where the condition of Account & Opportunity object is satisfied, we will fire the below query

SELECT Name, Industry, (SELECT Amount FROM Opportunities WHERE Amount = 30000) 
FROM Account 
WHERE Industry = 'Chemicals' AND Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE Amount = 30000)

//In the above query (as per scenario 3), The AccountId is the field on the Opportunity object that holds the reference to the related Account
//This subquery retrieves a list of AccountIds from Opportunities where the Amount is 30,000
//So, Id in this context is checking if the Id of the Account record is present in the list of AccountIds obtained from the subquery
//So, whether it's a standard or custom lookup relationship, you typically reference the Id field of the parent object in the child object's lookup field
